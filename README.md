# Reverb

a poor implementation of the echo command from coreutils in Rust 

I did this for fun in my spare time

key difference waiting to be implemented is finishing implementing all of the escape sequence replacements

after I did this I was happy to see that gnu coreutils and I vaguely share the same approach. thought I can probably guarantee they did it better.
